# 2D-Frictional-Impact

The Matlab code is for solving post impact velocities of two objects. All the details of the algorithm are given in our paper "http://robotics.cs.iastate.edu/papers/IJRR19.pdf". 

In the code, a polygon is treated as the object and an ellipse is used as a bat. They can be plotted by run the file "polygon_ellipse.m". 

The file "ep_impact_test.m" is used to generate different impact cases as shown in Fig.3 of the paper. Most names of the variables are following that in the paper.
